**Subject:** Feedback on Performance Appraisal Comments  

Dear [Manager's Name],  

I would like to share my comments on the appraisal feedback, as I believe the rating provided does not accurately reflect my contributions, efforts, and dedication.  

1. **Technical Skills**:  
   - As a senior team member, I have consistently handled the most challenging tasks, such as those in **Web ETS**, completing them under immense pressure and unrealistic deadlines.  
   - I resolved critical bugs in **Project EQDPO**, ensuring seamless project functionality.  
   - In **Web ETS**, I fixed a task previously rolled back after being developed by the most senior person. I successfully replicated and resolved the issue.  
   - Additionally, I have regularly guided junior team members, offering technical support and mentorship to help them grow. This can be confirmed by team members themselves.  
   - Despite these efforts, questioning my technical skills feels unjustified and undermines my contributions.  

2. **Behavior**:  
   - I resolved a significant production rollback issue caused by incorrect database harmonization suggested by a senior member. I fixed the issue without complaints, prioritizing the project's success.  
   - I have always maintained a professional and collaborative attitude. It is disappointing to see my behavior being questioned when my focus has always been on delivering quality results.  

3. **Availability**:  
   - I have consistently prioritized my responsibilities, providing support during blocked leave, weekends, and after hours.  
   - Even after receiving this feedback, I continue to work beyond normal hours, demonstrating my dedication. Questioning my availability feels baseless and unfair.  

**Conclusion**:  
I strongly feel the rating provided is biased and does not align with my performance. It creates a wrong impression despite my consistent hard work and contributions. While I respect the feedback process, I request a reevaluation of my performance.  

Thank you for your consideration.  

Best regards,  
[Your Name]
