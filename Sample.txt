Subject: jQuery Upgrade Impact & Testing Update - [Ticket #]
Hi [Tech Lead Name],
Following up on the jQuery upgrade ticket and the issues raised by the tester.
The jQuery upgrade has had a significant impact on existing JavaScript files, including:
 * Individual page scripts:  [Mention specific examples or areas affected if possible]
 * External plugins:  Specifically, the jquery.layout.latest.js plugin is being affected, causing layout issues on several pages.
Regarding the unit testing question, [ Briefly address the unit testing situation. For example: "The unit tests are currently being updated to reflect the changes in the jQuery version." or "I'm working with [whoever is responsible] to ensure comprehensive unit test coverage for the impacted code."]
As I previously mentioned, the blotter page isn't functional in my local environment, and we need to test it on a hosted environment.  Unfortunately, the Dev environment isn't accessible for the NAV portal, and the UAT URL is currently not working for me. This is why the tester initially reported the errors.
I've already resolved the popup error and the blotter page error in the code. However, due to the environment constraints, I'm unable to fully test the fixes locally.
I've dedicated extra time to prioritize this issue and ensure it's resolved quickly. I plan to deploy these changes tomorrow and conduct thorough testing with the tester on the UAT environment (assuming the URL is accessible then).
You can review my latest commits for the fixes here: [Link to your commit(s)]
Please let me know if you have any questions or need further updates.
Thanks,
[Your Name]
