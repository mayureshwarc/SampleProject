**Setting Up CI/CD for MS SQL Database Scripts in Jenkins**

### Prerequisites:
1. **Jenkins** is installed and running.
2. **Git** is installed on the Jenkins server (or configure it within Jenkins).
3. **SQLCMD** or **PowerShell** script can be used for executing database scripts.
4. **Database access** and credentials are configured for Jenkins to connect to the SQL Server.

---

### Step-by-Step Process:

#### Step 1: Set up a Git Repository
- Ensure that your MS SQL database scripts (e.g., schema changes, stored procedures) are stored in a **Git repository** (e.g., GitHub, GitLab, Bitbucket).
- This allows Jenkins to pull the latest database scripts and perform necessary tasks.

#### Step 2: Install Jenkins Plugins
You need a few Jenkins plugins to help with SQL deployment.

1. **Git Plugin**: To integrate Jenkins with your Git repository.
   - Go to **Manage Jenkins** → **Manage Plugins** → **Available**.
   - Search for **Git Plugin**, install, and restart Jenkins.

2. **SQLPlus/SQLCMD**: To execute SQL scripts.
   - Install the **SQLCMD** utility on the Jenkins server, as it is used to interact with SQL Server.
   - Alternatively, if you're using PowerShell, ensure PowerShell is set up correctly on the Jenkins server.

#### Step 3: Create a Jenkins Job (Pipeline or Freestyle)
You can either use a **Freestyle job** or a **Pipeline job** in Jenkins. Below is a detailed guide for a **Pipeline job**.

##### 3.1 Create a New Pipeline Job
1. In Jenkins, click on **New Item**.
2. Enter a name for your job and choose **Pipeline**.
3. Click **OK**.

##### 3.2 Configure the Pipeline Job
1. **Source Code Management**:
   - In the **Pipeline** configuration, under **Source Code Management**, select **Git**.
   - Provide the Git repository URL and credentials if required.

2. **Branch Specifier**:
   - Choose the branch where the SQL scripts are stored (e.g., `main` or `master`).

3. **Pipeline Script**:
   - Under **Pipeline**, select **Pipeline script** and add the following steps to automate the process.

---

### Step 4: Define the Pipeline Script (Jenkinsfile)

Here’s an example **Jenkinsfile** for deploying SQL scripts to SQL Server using `sqlcmd`:

```groovy
pipeline {
    agent any
    environment {
        // Define environment variables for SQL Server credentials
        SQL_SERVER = 'your_sql_server_name'
        SQL_USER = 'your_sql_user'
        SQL_PASSWORD = 'your_sql_password'
        DATABASE = 'your_database_name'
    }
    stages {
        stage('Checkout') {
            steps {
                // Checkout the latest code from Git repository
                git 'https://github.com/your-repository/your-database-scripts.git'
            }
        }
        stage('Build') {
            steps {
                script {
                    // Assuming you are running SQL scripts via sqlcmd
                    // Loop through SQL scripts in the repository and execute them
                    def sqlScripts = findFiles(glob: '**/*.sql')
                    sqlScripts.each { script ->
                        bat """
                            sqlcmd -S ${SQL_SERVER} -d ${DATABASE} -U ${SQL_USER} -P ${SQL_PASSWORD} -i ${script.path}
                        """
                    }
                }
            }
        }
        stage('Test') {
            steps {
                script {
                    // Optionally run some database tests here (e.g., integration tests or data validation).
                    echo "Testing database deployment..."
                }
            }
        }
        stage('Deploy') {
            steps {
                script {
                    // After testing, deploy changes to target environments (if applicable)
                    echo "Deploying database changes to production environment..."
                    // Your production SQL Server deployment logic goes here.
                }
            }
        }
    }
    post {
        always {
            echo "Cleaning up"
            // Perform any necessary cleanup actions
        }
    }
}
```

#### Explanation:
- **Checkout**: Pulls the latest changes from your Git repository.
- **Build**: Runs the SQL scripts using `sqlcmd` (or you can replace this with PowerShell if preferred).
- **Test**: Optional stage for running tests on your database.
- **Deploy**: Deploys your scripts to the SQL Server (in this case, the target environment is set up for deployment).

##### Step 5: Set Up Credentials
You can store your database credentials in Jenkins' **Credentials Manager**:

1. Go to **Manage Jenkins** → **Manage Credentials**.
2. Add your SQL Server credentials under **(Global)** or in a specific domain (e.g., `SQL_USER` and `SQL_PASSWORD`).
3. In your `Jenkinsfile`, reference the credentials securely like this:

```groovy
environment {
    SQL_USER = credentials('sql-user-credentials-id')
    SQL_PASSWORD = credentials('sql-password-credentials-id')
}
```

---

### Step 6: Run the Job
Once you have configured the pipeline, click **Save** and **Build Now**.

- Jenkins will automatically pull the latest SQL scripts, execute them on your SQL Server, and deploy the changes to your database.

---

### Step 7: Automate Trigger
You can set up automatic triggers for your Jenkins job, such as:
- **Poll SCM**: To trigger the job when changes are detected in the Git repository.
- **Webhooks**: Configure GitHub or GitLab webhooks to trigger Jenkins builds automatically on push events.

---

### Step 8: Monitoring and Logs
- Check the **Console Output** in Jenkins to monitor the progress of each stage.
- You can add additional logic in your pipeline to handle failures or rollbacks, ensuring safer deployments.

---

### Additional Tips:
- **SQL Server Authentication**: If you're using **Windows Authentication**, you may need to adjust the `sqlcmd` command to use integrated security (`-E` instead of `-U` and `-P`).
- **Error Handling**: Ensure that you handle errors and rollbacks in case something goes wrong during the deployment.
- **Database Unit Tests**: Incorporate unit tests for SQL using tools like **tSQLt** to validate database changes before deployment.

---

This setup automates the process of running and deploying your MS SQL database scripts using Jenkins CI/CD pipelines.
