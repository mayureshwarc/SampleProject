**Subject:** Request for Early Release from Current Role

Dear [Manager's Name],

I hope you're doing well.

As already discussed with you over a call, I would like to formally request an early release from my current role and responsibilities, due to ongoing health issues.

Currently, I am not assigned any critical project-related tasks, and considering my health condition—which requires rest and frequent therapy sessions—I am unable to attend office in this state.

Given the situation, I would like to request one of the following options as a way forward:

1. Kindly consider releasing me before **28th April 2025**, or  
2. Allow me to **work from home** for the remaining notice period, or  
3. Grant me **medical leave** to recover, post which I can return and complete the notice period.

I truly appreciate your understanding and support during this difficult time. Please let me know how we can proceed on this.

Best regards,  
[Your Full Name]
