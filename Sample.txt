**Subject:** Feedback on Performance Appraisal Comments  

Dear [Manager's Name],  

I hope you are doing well. I wanted to provide my comments on the appraisal feedback as I feel that the rating I received is not aligned with my contributions, efforts, and dedication. I would like to outline my perspective on the areas mentioned in the feedback:  

1. **Technical Skills**:  
   - As a senior team member, I have consistently handled the most challenging tasks across multiple projects, including **Web ETS**. Despite immense pressure and unrealistic deadlines, I successfully completed the tasks assigned to me.  
   - I provided critical resolutions for bugs in **Project EQDPO**, ensuring smooth functionality.  
   - In **Web ETS**, a task previously developed by the most senior person was rolled back after release. The task was assigned to me, and I successfully replicated and fixed the issue.  
   - I have also guided junior team members on complex issues, offering technical support and mentoring them to help enhance their skills and confidence. You can confirm this with the team members themselves.  
   - Given my consistent track record of delivering under pressure, resolving complex issues, and supporting my team, questioning my technical skills feels unwarranted and does not reflect my contributions accurately.  

2. **Behavior**:  
   - I resolved a significant production rollback issue caused by incorrect database harmonization suggested by a senior member. I worked diligently to fix the problem without raising any concerns or complaints, prioritizing the project's success over everything.  
   - I have always maintained a professional and team-oriented attitude, focusing on collaboration and achieving project goals. I believe my behavior has been exemplary, and it is disheartening to see this being questioned.  

3. **Availability**:  
   - I have always prioritized my responsibilities and ensured my availability for the team and the project. I provided support even during blocked leave, weekends, and after working hours.  
   - Despite the current feedback, I am still supporting the team outside of regular hours, demonstrating my unwavering commitment. Questioning my availability feels baseless and does not reflect the reality of my efforts.  

**Conclusion**:  
I strongly feel that the rating provided is biased and not reviewed properly. It does not fairly represent my dedication, technical skills, or contributions to the team and the organization. This rating creates a wrong impression about my performance and impacts my morale despite my continuous hard work.  

While I respect the feedback process, I am unable to accept this rating and request a reevaluation of my performance. I hope this detailed clarification helps provide better insight into my efforts and contributions.  

Thank you for your understanding and consideration.  

Best regards,  
[Your Name]
