**Subject**: Update on RCA for Document Upload Issue

Hi [Lead's Name],

I wanted to provide some context regarding the delay in writing the RCA for the document upload issue.

This issue was first encountered before my block leave. During that sprint, I was assigned multiple issues, including a major development task for an upcoming release. While I began researching the document issue, I couldn't finalize the RCA and proposed actions on the JIRA ticket because my focus was on completing the major development, which had to be closed before my block leave as per the plan. I successfully completed the development and resolved a bug reported by the tester before going on leave.

During my block leave, the tester reported two minor issues. I provided support via call and messages to help resolve one of them, while the other was resolved after I resumed work. Upon returning, I was occupied with closing the second minor issue and handling a last-minute change request from the client.

Now, I have updated the JIRA ticket with a detailed RCA and action plan for the document upload issue. If you need any further information, please feel free to reach out.

Best regards,  
[Your Name]
