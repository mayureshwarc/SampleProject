Hi [Tester Name],

Thank you for reporting the issues.

Regarding the first issue, as discussed previously, this is a legacy issue on the main product page. Fixing it will require more time due to its complexity and the impact on the core functionality. We'll prioritize this, but it will take longer to resolve.

I have already fixed the second issue and raised a pull request for it. Since the RLP dev database is currently offline, I wasn't able to test it locally. Could you please review the PR at your earliest convenience? Once approved, you can ask the AP team to deploy it on UAT, and [Tester Name] can retest the fix. This is a small change, only affecting a condition in the stored procedure.

Please let me know if you need any additional information.

Thanks and regards,
[Your Name]
[Your Position]
