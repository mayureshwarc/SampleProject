HI KARNIK Nrupen,
I am reaching out to report significant concerns about my current work environment, specifically the conduct of my manager, Mehak Jain, and her manager, Disha Gupta which I believe constitutes harassment and is affecting my ability to perform effectively.
Background and Contributions
Since joining ISPL, I have dedicated over five years to the company, consistently delivering quality work across multiple departments.
I initially worked in the BOTW department, where I received positive ratings during tenure for my performance, led critical deliveries, and earned a retention bonus for my commitment.
After BOTW's closure in June 2023, I transferred to my current department, where I successfully managed the Exane migration without any issues, achieving a better rating for that year.
Recent Changes and Current Issues
Since [past] few months, following a management change, my experience has shifted dramatically. From the outset, I have felt targeted by my new reporting authority, Mehak Jain, and her manager, Disha Gupta, often without clear or justified reasoning.
Below [are] some examples of the issues I am facing:
 * Excessive and Unreasonable Work Hours: I am frequently asked to log out late and work on Saturdays, which I comply with. Recently, I was instructed to work overnight to resolve a longstanding issue, despite having flagged it a month ago.
 * Disregard for Personal Circumstances: Despite notifying my managers that my wife and daughter were unwell, they continued to demand that I stay logged in and complete development tasks overnight.
 * Lack of Respect for Leave: During my block leave, I was called repeatedly with work queries, and I still provided support. Recently, I was threatened with cancellation of my planned leave and warned that I might be put on a Performance Improvement Plan (PIP) for taking an unplanned leave, which I find unfair and punitive.
 * Inappropriate Assignment of Blame: I resolved a critical production bug caused by a development Mehak authored, finding and fixing the issue after she struggled to replicate it. Additionally, after completing an assignment per my lead's analysis, I was later blamed for a production issue arising from this work, despite the code having passed testing on UAT and client review.
 * Continuous Monitoring and Threat of PIP: Every month, I am asked to provide incident reports for my work. Despite my proven track record and having resolved issues proactively, I am continuously threatened with a PIP, which only adds to the stress.
Request for Support
The above incidents, compounded over the past few months, have created a hostile work environment, impacting my motivation and well-being. I am committed to delivering high-quality work, but I am finding it increasingly difficult to do so under these circumstances.
I am reaching out to [you] with the hope that my concerns will be addressed fairly, and that I will receive support in fostering a more positive and respectful work environment.
Thank you for your attention to this matter. I am happy to provide supporting documentation, including message and call records during the block leave.
Regards,
