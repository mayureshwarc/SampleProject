 **Subject:** Resignation  

Dear [HR Manager's Name],  

I am resigning from my position at [Bank Name] due to a toxic work environment created by my immediate manager and their superior. The immediate manager lacks authority and problem-solving ability, functioning merely as a puppet, while the manager's manager exhibits ego-driven leadership. Instead of fostering collaboration, they resort to intimidationâ€”threatening PIPs over trivial matters and publicly humiliating team members. This hostile atmosphere has made it impossible to work with dignity, and I see no growth or recognition here.  

I appreciate the organization but can no longer tolerate this unprofessional behavior.  

Sincerely,  
[Your Name]
