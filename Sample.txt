**Issue**: Document missing after uploading.

**Root Cause Analysis (RCA)**:
- During the document upload process, a folder is first created to store the document.
- If the document upload fails, no folder entry is saved in the database.
- If the document is successfully uploaded, two entries are created in the database:
  - One for the folder.
  - One for the document.
- After the document upload entry is created, the folder's row ID is assigned as the parent ID in the document entry.
  
The issue arises in the method `GetMaxDocumentId()`, which controls this process. This method retrieves the previous document ID from the session. If:
  - The session returns a null or incorrect value, the default parent ID is set, which results in mapping the document to the wrong folder.
  
As a result, even though the document is present in the database, it's not displayed because the wrong parent folder ID is assigned. The issue appears to be related to session handling across multiple nodes of the web server, similar to an issue encountered previously in the NAV Portal where session management was problematic.

**Proposed Action**:
1. **Long-term fix**: Remove the session logic and update the process to use a more reliable method for retrieving the document ID. However, this may take considerable time to implement.
   
2. **Quick workaround**: Similar to the NAV Portal fix, temporarily shut down one web server node. If the issue is not reported again, engage the AP team to adjust the load balancer configuration, as was done in the NAV portal fix.
