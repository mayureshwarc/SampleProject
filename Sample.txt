Throughout my time on this project, I have consistently ensured that my work was completed on time, and whenever delays were expected, I communicated them well in advance. Despite facing gaps in requirements, I took the initiative to analyze and implement necessary changes, ensuring that the project moved forward without unnecessary roadblocks. Even in high-pressure situations like Web ETS, where there was barely any time for thorough analysis, I managed to complete my tasks efficiently and deliver on time without compromising on quality. I kept my seniors informed about every step I took, had my work reviewed by them, and ensured that all changes successfully passed the UAT environment. However, when issues arose in production, instead of addressing them objectively, I was unfairly blamed, while accountability at higher levels was conveniently overlooked. Despite this, I made every effort to rectify issues and do things the right way, but I did not receive the necessary support from my team, making the situation even more challenging. Moreover, I provided proof of my work in every meeting, highlighted key updates in Jira ticket comments, and communicated everything via Teams and email. Yet, these were disregarded with the excuse that seniors did not have time to check, which raises the questionâ€”what kind of communication was expected from me? Instead of acknowledging my efforts and the steps I took, I was repeatedly made a scapegoat, subjected to biased reviews, and denied constructive feedback that could have helped me improve. The ongoing stress and unfair treatment created a toxic work environment that took a serious toll on my health, leading to a critical medical condition. No professional should have to endure such circumstances. A fair and healthy workplace thrives on teamwork, transparency, and shared accountability, and I strongly believe that fostering these values is essential for both individual and organizational growth.
