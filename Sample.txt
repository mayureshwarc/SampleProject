Subject: Analysis and Resolution for Underlying History Table Issue

Dear [Manager's Name],

I would like to inform you about an issue related to the **Underlying History Page** feature, which I developed. 

The tables `underlying_history` and `underlyingwebsite_history` are designed to log changes, but due to a known SQL behavior, when an `UPDATE` statement is executed on the main table without any actual data change, the associated trigger creates an unnecessary row in the history tables. This issue occurs both when updates are performed through the UI and by the agent `ImportUnderlyingDataSA`, resulting in multiple rows being inserted into the history table for the same ISIN without any actual change.

I have already analyzed the issue and documented the findings in the related Jira ticket. To resolve this, I propose modifying the trigger logic to ensure that it only inserts rows when there are actual changes in the data. 

Please let me know if you have any concerns or require further clarification. 

Best regards,  
[Your Name]

**Solution Implementation Steps (Technical Details)**  

1. **Modify the Trigger Logic**:  
   Update the SQL trigger to compare the `OLD` and `NEW` values before performing an insertion into the history table. This ensures that no new row is added if the `UPDATE` statement does not alter the data.  

2. **Updated Trigger Example**:
   ```sql
   CREATE OR REPLACE TRIGGER trg_underlying_history
   AFTER UPDATE ON main_table
   FOR EACH ROW
   BEGIN
       IF (:OLD.column1 != :NEW.column1 OR :OLD.column2 != :NEW.column2 OR ...) THEN
           INSERT INTO underlying_history (column1, column2, ...)
           VALUES (:NEW.column1, :NEW.column2, ...);
       END IF;
   END;
   ```

   - Replace `column1`, `column2`, etc., with the actual columns in your table.
   - Ensure all columns that are prone to changes are included in the comparison.

3. **Test the Changes**:  
   - Run test cases to verify that the history table is updated only when actual changes occur in the main table.
   - Test updates from both the UI and the `ImportUnderlyingDataSA` agent.

4. **Deploy the Updated Trigger**:  
   - Apply the trigger modification to your development environment first.
   - Perform regression testing to ensure no unintended side effects occur.

5. **Monitor Post-Deployment**:  
   - After deploying to production, monitor the history table to confirm that unnecessary rows are no longer being inserted.

Let me know if you need additional clarification on implementing this solution.
