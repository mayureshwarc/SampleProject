It's great that you're taking the initiative to reflect on your performance and align it with your objectives! Here's how you can frame your self-appraisal feedback for this generic objective:
Respect of Code of Conduct, Rules & Regulations
I consistently demonstrate adherence to the company's Code of Conduct, rules, and regulations. I believe in maintaining high ethical standards and ensuring my actions align with the company's values. This includes:
 * Acting with Integrity: I conduct myself professionally and ethically in all interactions with colleagues, clients, and partners.
 * Compliance with Regulations: I am fully aware of and comply with all applicable laws, regulatory requirements, and company procedures.
 * Upholding Ethical Standards: I prioritize the seven themes of the Code of Conduct – Customer Interest, Financial Security, Market Integrity, Professional Ethics, Respect for Persons, Group Protection, and Involvement within Society – in my daily work.
 * Completion of Mandatory Training: I have successfully completed all mandatory Group training within the required deadlines, ensuring I stay updated on the latest compliance requirements and company policies.
I am committed to maintaining a workplace that upholds the highest standards of professionalism and ethical conduct. I believe my actions consistently reflect this commitment.
Additional Tips:
 * Provide Specific Examples: Whenever possible, include specific examples of how you've demonstrated adherence to the Code of Conduct. This could include instances where you had to make ethical decisions, situations where you went above and beyond to ensure compliance, or times when you proactively educated yourself on new regulations.
 * Connect to Company Values: Explicitly connect your actions to the company's values and mission. This shows that you understand the importance of the Code of Conduct in the broader context of the organization.
 * Highlight Proactive Measures: If you've taken any proactive steps to promote ethical behavior or compliance within your team or department, be sure to mention them.
By framing your self-appraisal in this way, you demonstrate your understanding of the objective and your commitment to upholding the company's values and standards.
