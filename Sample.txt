 Due to a refusal in one particular incident involving Disha and Mehak, I faced significant difficulties. Immediately after the incident, I informed the HR team that I had received a threat from Disha, stating that she would initiate a PIP against me. Unfortunately, that threat became a reality, and I was given an unfair performance rating of 5 despite my strong work history, which clearly reflects my contributions and performance. It is disheartening that just one refusal led to such treatment. The behavior of these two individuals created a hostile work environment, which ultimately impacted my well-being. As a result, I faced a critical health condition and was left with no choice but to resign from this esteemed organization. What makes this situation even more unfortunate is that I had to leave without securing another job, solely due to the unjust and toxic environment created by these individuals.
