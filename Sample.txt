**Subject:** Urgent Follow-up: Workplace Harassment and Unfair Treatment  

Dear [HR Representative's Name],  

I am writing to follow up on the concerns I raised in my previous email regarding the hostile work environment created by my manager, Mehak Jain, and her manager, Disha Gupta. Despite bringing these issues to your attention, the situation has only worsened, and I am deeply disappointed by the lack of action taken.  

### 1. Unfair Performance Rating & Continued Harassment  
After raising my concerns, I was unfairly given a performance rating of 5, which I accepted in good faith to move forward in my career. However, despite my efforts to focus on my work, there is an ongoing conspiracy against me, including false accusations and an attempt to discredit my contributions.  

### 2. False Allegations & Unjustified Criticism  
In our recent meetings, several false allegations have been made against me:  
- **Claim: My releases have been rolled back frequently**  
  - **Fact:** I am attaching data from last year’s Web ETS project releases, which prove the success of my deployments. For the few incidents that did occur, my responsibility has been unfairly exaggerated.  
- **Claim: I take excessive time for development**  
  - **Fact:** I request a proper analysis of my JIRA records to verify the timelines of my development tasks. There is no evidence that I have delayed any feature development.  
- **Claim: I am not available enough**  
  - **Fact:** Due to extreme stress and workplace pressure, I have had to visit a doctor regularly. However, I have consistently stretched my working hours, worked weekends, and remained available for work-related queries. I expect a clear answer—what action has been taken against those who violated my block leave by repeatedly calling and engaging me in work discussions? Does ISPL policy allow managers to disrupt an employee’s block leave?  

### 3. Lack of Proper Management & Leadership  
There is a serious leadership failure in my team, which is directly contributing to these issues:  
- **No Formal Requirement Gathering:** There is no structured documentation of requirements. Even when our team lead documents something, it lacks details.  
- **Unrealistic Timelines:** Commitments are made to the client without proper analysis, and when I request time for impact analysis, I am told to proceed with development first. Later, if issues arise, I am blamed. JIRA comments will verify this pattern.  
- **Lack of Support from Leadership:** My managers do not provide proper requirements, do not review JIRA updates, fail to provide technical guidance, and approve pull requests without reviewing them. If they are not fulfilling their responsibilities, what is their role in the team?  
- **Intentional Targeting:** This pattern of mismanagement and lack of accountability suggests a deliberate effort to set me up for failure. The ongoing bi-weekly meetings feel less like a platform for support and more like a targeted blame game against me.  

### 4. Detrimental Impact on My Health & Well-Being  
The continued harassment, unjustified criticism, and leadership failures have had a severe impact on my mental health. I have attached my latest medical consultation report from my psychiatrist, which confirms that my medication dosage has increased. I have been advised to take two weeks of medical leave, and my doctor has warned that failure to rest may lead to hospitalization and shock treatment.  

I have applied for two weeks of leave and request that my medical details remain confidential. I am seeking your immediate intervention and action on this matter. I need assurance that upon my return, I will not continue to face this toxic work environment.  

### 5. Urgent Questions for HR:  
- What action has been taken in response to my initial complaint?  
- Where is ISPL’s policy on employee well-being and mental health?  
- Where is ISPL’s policy on work-life balance and protection from harassment?  
- Is it allowed for managers to repeatedly call an employee on block leave?  

This is no longer just a workplace issue—it is a serious matter affecting my mental and physical well-being. I expect a swift and transparent response regarding the steps being taken to address this situation.  

I hope ISPL takes this matter seriously and demonstrates its commitment to employee welfare. I look forward to your prompt response.  

Sincerely,  
[Your Name]
